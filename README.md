# Customer Churn Prediction App 🚀

This project is an **end-to-end Customer Churn Prediction application** built using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**, deployed with **Streamlit**.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their profile and service usage.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- Used the **Churn Modelling dataset**
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical variables
- Trained multiple models with **hyperparameter tuning**
- Built an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for better prediction performance
- Saved trained artifacts as **`.pkl` and `.h5` files**
- Integrated everything into an interactive **Streamlit web application**

## 🧠 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
2. One-Hot Encoding of categorical features  
3. Train-test split  
4. Hyperparameter tuning for improved reliability  
5. Model training (ANN)  
6. Saving trained models:
   - `.pkl` files for scalers/encoders
   - `.h5` file for the ANN model  
7. Deployment using **Streamlit**
